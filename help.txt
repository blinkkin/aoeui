Welcome to aoeui, pmk's text editor optimized for fellow users of...

Dvorak		   TAB  ' , . P Y  F G C R L  / = \
Simplified	  LOCK  A O E U I  D H T N S  - ENTER
Keyboard	 SHIFT  ; Q J K X  B M W V Z  SHIFT

To leave aoeui now, perhaps because you arrived here by accident,
hold down the Control key, hit the Space bar, and then the backslash (\)
key.  (This emergency escape sequence is deliberately hard to type
so that you won't accidentally terminate the editor and lose work.)

COMMANDS are indicated here with notation like ^L, which means that
the L key is to be struck
  - with one of the Control keys held down -- the standard method, or
  - with one of the ALT keys held down, or
  - after pressing the Esc(ape) key.

The ^L command proceeds to the next screenful of text.  ^R returns to the
previous screenful of text.  These are the two commands you will need to
know first to navigate this help file.

Non-control characters are inserted into the text.  If the cursor is at
the beginning of a selection, the selection is first cut as if ^D had
been used.  If the cursor is at the end of a selection, the new text is
appended to it.

Many commands have variant forms that are accessed by first hitting ^Space
before the command.  Also, many commands alter their behavior depending
on the presence or absence of a selection, which is a highlighted
contiguous fragment of text that has the cursor at one end and the "mark"
at its other.

NAVIGATION in a text by...	BACKWARD	FORWARD
	single character	^H		^T
	word			^N		^S
	sentence		^Space^N	^Space^S
	line			^G		^C
	screenful		^R		^L
	entire view		^Space^R	^Space^L
	([{ balanced expression }])	   ^]
	recenter screen			   ^Z
	specific line number		^Space 123 ^Z

SELECTION and MODIFICATION
	  without a selection	with a selection
      ^V  begin a selection	abandon selection
^Space^V  select entire line	exchange cursor with mark
      ^F			replace clip buffer with copied selection
^Space^F			add copy of selection to clip buffer
      ^D  delete character	replace clip buffer with deleted selection
^Space^D  select whitespace	add deleted selection to clip buffer
      ^B  paste			exchange selection with clip buffer

BACKSPACE deletes the character before the cursor.

^U undoes the most recent command; ^Space^U after one or more ^U commands
repeats the undone command.  Any command that modifies the text after ^U
beside ^Space^U commits the undone commands.

^Space TAB (or ^I) aligns the current line to the indentation of the
previous one.  ^Space 8 TAB (or ^I) sets the text's tab stop to 8, say;
any value between 1 and 20 will work.  ^ENTER (or ^J) inserts
a new line with automatic indentation.  ^Space ENTER (or ^M) opens up
a new line after the current one.

^^ (that's Control-Caret, shift-6) reads the next character that you
type and inserts it into the text without interpreting it as a command.
If it's a non-control character, ^^ converts it into one.  With a
decimal argument (^Space 65 ^^) or hexadecimal one (^Space x200 ^^),
this command inserts Unicode code points encoded as UTF-8.

VIEWS, TEXTS, and WINDOWS
      ^Y  split the current window horizontally
^Space^Y  split the current window vertically
      ^P  move to another window
^Space^P  close the current window and move to the next one
      ^W  replace the current window with an invisible view
^Space^W  close the current view and replace it with an invisible one
      ^X  without a selection:  insert the text's file name as the selection
      ^X  with a selection: open the file whose name is in the selection
^Space^X  with a selection: rename the current next with the selection
      ^K  save all modified texts back to their files
^Space^K  save just the current text
      ^Q  suspend the editor
^Space^Q  save all buffers and terminate the editor
^Space^\  abort the editor without saving any text
^Space ;  create a new anonymous text (note that ; is not a Control character)

^/ and ^_ enter SEARCH MODE.  Characters that are typed are appended to the
search pattern and the next occurrence of the pattern is selected.  Case of
alphabetic characters is not significant to the search.  In search mode,
  BACKSPACE removes characters from the search pattern
  ^/	    with no pattern causes the last search's pattern to be used
  ^H and ^T  move backward and forward to other instances of the pattern
All other commands leave search mode and use the latest hit as the selection.
^V is commonly used to leave search mode and unset the selection.

EXTENSION
^E executes the shell pipeline command in the selection, passes the
contents of the clip buffer as its standard input, and replaces the
selection with the standard output of the command.  The child process
executes asynchronously and its output appears in the view in real time.
^Space^E with no selection terminates any active child process.

Handy commands to use with ^E include:

   cd path	to change the current working directory (a special case)
   cat path	to insert the contents of a file or FIFO into the text
   grep -n	to search for lines containing a pattern
   sort		to rearrange lines
   uniq		to discard duplicated lines
   sed 's/FROM/TO/g' to perform global search-and-replace
   tr a-z A-Z	to convert lower to upper case
   tr -d '[\r]'	to remove DOS carriage-returns (^M)
   fmt		to reformat paragraphs of text
   indent -st -kr -i8 -nbbo
		to reformat C source code sensibly
   column	to align data into columns
   man | colcrt	to read a man page ("| col -b" works, too)
   tailf	to monitor additions to a file you're watching
   make		to compile (run it in a scratch text)

To capture the output of commands run in other windows, use "mkfifo foo"
to create a FIFO,  "cat foo" with ^E to catch whatever is written there,
and then redirect the other commands' output with ">foo".  This is a
very powerful technique.

MACROS
^Space^A begins recording keystrokes as the view's macro.  ^A ends recording
if it is active, otherwise ^A causes the macro to be executed by replaying
the saved keystrokes.

FILES
aoeui can browse very large read-only files, since original texts are mapped
from files and not duplicated until they are modified.  Original copies of
files are saved in file~ before ^K overwrites them.  Temporary copies of
files being edited may be found in file# if the editor aborts (^Space^\).
Anonymous texts newly created by ^W, ^Y, and ^Space; are kept in $HOME/.aoeui.

BOOKMARKS
The location of the current position or selection, if any, can be recorded
as numbered bookmark 6, say, with the command ^Space 6 = .  The command
^Space 6 - returns to the bookmark, raising or activating its view if
necessary.  (Note that the = and - characters are not Control characters.)
The default bookmark is number 0.

TIPS
 - To select the rest of the line after the cursor: ^V^C
 - It is often faster to retype a bungled word than to fix it: ^V^N (retype)
 - Transposing multiple blocks of text is easy with ^B, which generalizes
   the usual paste operation into an exchange of the clip buffer with the
   selection.
 - Incremental search and replace can be done with a macro (^Space^A)
   or by clipping the replacement text, and on search hits that are to be
   replaced, using ^B^F^/^/ to exchange the hit with the replacement text,
   copy it back to the clip buffer, and proceed to the next occurrence of the
   search pattern.  But if the replacement text is short, it's sometimes
   easiest to just overwrite the selection with ^V and retyping.
 - Reconfigure your keyboard so that the key to the left of A, which is probably
   labelled Caps Lock, is interpreted as a Control modifier, while the left
   Control key takes on the rare Caps Lock function.

THANKS to my lovely wife for putting up with her Dvorak-obsessed husband
for a few evenings recently as aoeui has been polished and uploaded!  And
to all you brave souls curious enough to play with it!

Welcome to aoeui, pmk's text editor optimized for fellow users of...

To leave aoeui now, perhaps because you arrived here by accident,
hold down the Control key, hit the Space bar, and then the backslash (\)
key.  (This emergency escape sequence is deliberately hard to type
so that you won't accidentally terminate the editor and lose work.)

Documentation for aoeui is now a standard manual page and should
be available with the shell command "man aoeui".

Bugs, complaints, suggestions, and greetings can be sent to
peter@klausler.com.  Please let me know how aoeui is working
for you.

THANKS to my lovely wife for putting up with her Dvorak-obsessed husband
for a few evenings recently as aoeui has been polished and uploaded, and
to all you brave souls curious enough to play with it!

Welcome to aoeui, pmk's text editor optimized for fellow users of...

To leave aoeui now, perhaps because you arrived here by accident, hit the
backslash key (\) while holding down one of the Control keys.

COMMANDS are indicated here with notation like ^L, which means that
the L key is to be struck
  - with one of the Control keys held down -- the standard method, or
  - with one of the ALT keys held down, or
  - after pressing the Esc(ape) key.

The ^L command proceeds to the next screenful of text.  ^R returns to the
previous screenful of text.  These are the two commands you will need to
know first to navigate this help file.

Non-control characters are inserted into the text.  If the cursor is at
the beginning of a selection, the selection is first cut as if ^D had
been used.  If the cursor is at the end of a selection, the new text is
appended to it.

Many commands have variant forms that are accessed by first hitting
^Space before the command.  Also, many commands alter their behavior
depending on the presence or absence of a selection, which is a highlighted
contiguous fragment of text that has the cursor at one end and the "mark"
at its other.

NAVIGATION in a text by...	BACKWARD	FORWARD
	single character	^H		^T
	word			^N		^S
	sentence		^Space^N	^Space^S
	line			^G		^C
	screenful		^R		^L
	entire view		^Space^R	^Space^L
	([{ balanced expression }])	   ^]
	recenter screen			   ^Z
	specific line number		^Space 123 ^Z

SELECTION and MODIFICATION
	  without a selection	with a selection
      ^V  begin a selection	exchange cursor with mark
^Space^V  select entire line	abandon selection
      ^F			replace clip buffer with copied selection
^Space^F			add copy of selection to clip buffer
      ^D  delete character	replace clip buffer with deleted selection
^Space^D  select whitespace	add deleted selection to clip buffer
      ^B  paste			exchange selection with clip buffer

BACKSPACE deletes the character before the cursor.

^U undoes the most recent command; ^Space^U after one or more ^U commands
repeats the undone command.  Any command that modifies the text after ^U
beside ^Space^U commits the undone commands.

^Space TAB (or ^I) aligns the current line to the indentation of the
previous one.  ^ENTER (or ^J) inserts a new line with automatic indentation.
^Space ENTER (or ^M) opens up a new line after the current one.

^^ (that's Control-Caret, shift-6) reads the next character that you
type and inserts it into the text without interpreting it as a command.
If it's a non-control character, ^^ converts it into one.

VIEWS, TEXTS, and WINDOWS
      ^Y  split the current window horizontally
^Space^Y  split the current window vertically
      ^P  move to another window
^Space^P  close the current window and move to the next one
      ^W  replace the current window with an invisible view
^Space^W  close the current view and replace it with an invisible one
      ^X  without a selection:  insert the text's file name as the selection
      ^X  with a selection: open the file whose name is in the selection
^Space^X  with a selection: rename the current next with the selection
      ^K  save all modified texts back to their files
^Space^K  save just the current text
      ^Q  suspend the editor
^Space^Q  save all buffers and terminate the editor
      ^\  abort the editor without saving any text

^/ and ^_ enter SEARCH MODE.  Characters that are typed are appended to the
search pattern and the next occurrence of the pattern is selected.  Case of
alphabetic characters is not significant to the search.  In search mode,
  BACKSPACE removes characters from the search pattern
  ^/	    with no pattern causes the last search's pattern to be used
  RETURN    terminates the search and unselects the latest occurrence
  ^H and ^T  move backward and forward to other instances of the pattern
All other commands leave search mode and use the latest hit as the selection.

EXTENSION
^E executes the shell pipeline command in the selection, passes the contents
of the clip buffer as its standard input, and replaces the selection with
the standard output of the command.  Handy commands to know include:
	cat path	to insert the contents of a file into the text
	sort		to rearrange lines
	sed 's/FROM/TO/g' to perform global search-and-replace
	tr a-z A-Z	to convert lower to upper case

^Space^A begins recording keystrokes as the view's macro.  ^A ends recording
if it is active, otherwise ^A causes the macro to be executed by replaying
the saved keystrokes.

FILES
aoeui can browse very large read-only files, since original texts are mapped
from files and not duplicated until they are modified.  Original copies of
files are saved in file~ before ^K overwrites them.  Temporary copies of
files being edited may be found in file# if the editor aborts (^\).
Unnamed texts newly created by ^W or ^Y are kept in $HOME/.aoeui.

TIPS
 - To select the rest of the line after the cursor: ^V^C
 - It is often faster to retype a bungled word than to fix it: ^V^N (retype)
 - Transposing multiple blocks of text is easy with ^B, which generalizes
   the usual paste operation into an exchange of the clip buffer with the
   selection.
 - Incremental search and replace can be done with a macro (^Space^A)
   or by clipping the replacement text, and on search hits that are to be
   replaced, using ^B^F^/^/ to exchange the hit with the replacement text,
   copy it back to the clip buffer, and proceed to the next occurrence of the
   search pattern.  But if the replacement text is short, it's sometimes
   easiest to just overwrite the selection with ^V and retyping.

THANKS to my lovely wife for putting up with her Dvorak-obsessed husband
for a few evenings recently as aoeui has been polished and uploaded!  And
to all you brave souls curious enough to play with it!

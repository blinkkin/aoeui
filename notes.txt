Commands are indicated by CTL, denoted here by ^.
ALT and ESC may also be used, and mean the same as CTL.
Non-command characters are inserted or searched for.
Self-insertion automatically cuts when cursor < mark.

There are multiple windows, views, and texts;  Every window has
a view, but not every view has a window.  Every view has a text
and every text has at least one view.  Some texts have files.
The cursor, mark, and macro are local to their view.

* below means "must be this character".
() indicate synonyms
[;] indicate variants activated by ^Space, possibly with value
/  indicates behavior with mark set

Idioms
- search and replace: cut replacement text, search for first occurrence,
  then repeat ^B^F^/^/ to exchange target with replacement, restore
  replacement text in the clip buffer, and proceed to the next hit
- also, can pipe text through sed 's/X/Y/g' for global replacement
- also, can use a macro
- exchanging cursor and mark and then retyping with automatic cut
  is often faster than an explicit cut.

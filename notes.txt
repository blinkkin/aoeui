Commands are denoted here in these notes by ^, which signifies use
of Control, Alt, or a leading Escape before a key.  (Some Control
keys don't work the same in a Linux console; Escape always works.
Control-[ is the same as Escape.)

Non-command characters are inserted or searched for.
Self-insertion automatically cuts when cursor < mark.

There are multiple windows, views, and texts;  Every window has a view,
but not every view has a window.  Every view has a text and every text
has at least one view.  Some texts have files.  The cursor, mark, and
macro are local to their view.

* below means "must be this character".
() indicate synonyms
[;] indicate variants activated by ^Space, possibly with value
/  indicates behavior with mark unset / set

Idioms
- search and replace: cut replacement text, search for first occurrence,
  then repeat ^B^F^/^/ to exchange target with replacement, restore
  replacement text in the clip buffer, and proceed to the next hit
- also, can pipe text through sed 's/X/Y/g' for global replacement
- also, can use a macro
- exchanging cursor and mark and then retyping with automatic cut
  is often faster than an explicit cut.

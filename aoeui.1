.SH NAME
aoeui \- a lightweight visual editor optimized for the Dvorak keyboard
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aoeui
[
.B -t
.I "tab stop"
]
.RI [ file... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B aoeui
is an interactive display text editor optimized for users of the
Dvorak keyboard layout, although QWERTY users are welcome to
use it as well.
.B aoeui
run with no file name arguments displays a short command
introduction and summary.
.P
.B aoeui
can browse very large read-only files with quick start-up,
since original texts are memory-mapped from files and not
duplicated in memory until they are about to be modified.
.SH BASICS
A
.I text
is a sequence of characters to be viewed or edited, such as a file.
A
.I view
comprises all or part of a text.
A text in the editor has at least one view, and possibly more.
.P
A
.I window
is a rectilinear portion of the display, and is always associated
with a single view, a contiguous portion of whose text is rendered
in the window.  Not every view has a window.
.P
Each view has a
.I cursor
and possibly a
.IR selection ,
which has the cursor at one end and the
.I mark
at the other.
The view's window, if any, always renders part of the text containing
the view's cursor.
.P
The
.I clip buffer
is not visible in any window.
It receives snippets of data that have been cut or copied out of
texts, so that they may be moved or copied elsewhere.
It also supplies the standard input to a background command
launched with
.B ^E
(below).
There is one clip buffer shared by all views.
.SH COMMANDS
.P
Commands are denoted here by
.B ^key
to signify the use of Control, Alt, or a leading Escape key.
They all mean the same thing.
.P
.B Variant
commands always begin with
.BR ^Space ,
or its synonym,
.BR ^@ .
A few commands take a numeric argument, which is specified by
.B ^Space
followed by a decimal or hexadecimal number, the latter
using C language syntax (0xdeadbeef).
.P
Many commands are sensitive to the presence or absence of a
.BR selection .
.SH LEAVING
.TP
.B ^Space^\e
aborts the editor, leaving no original file modified since the
last time
.B ^K
was used.
.TP
.B ^Q
suspends the editor and returns the terminal to the shell that
invoked it.
Use the shell's foreground command, probably
.BR fg ,
to resume editing.
.TP
.B ^Space^Q
saves all modified texts and terminates the editor.
.SH NAVIGATION
.TP
.B ^H
moves the cursor backward one character.
.TP
.B ^T
moves the cursor forward one characters.
.TP
.B ^N
moves the cursor backward one word.
.TP
.B ^S
moves the cursor forward one word.
.TP
.B ^Space^N
moves the cursor backward one sentence.
.TP
.B ^Space^S
moves the cursor forward one sentence.
.TP
.B ^G
moves the cursor back to the beginning of the line.
If already there, it moves back to the beginniong of the previous line.
.TP
.B ^C
moves the cursor forward to the end of the line.
If already there, it moves forward to the end of the next line.
.TP
.B ^R
moves the window backward one screenful.
.TP
.B ^L
moves the window forward one screenful.
.TP
.B ^Space^R
moves to the very beginning of the view.
.TP
.B ^Space^L
moves to the very end of the view.
.TP
.B ^]
moves to the corresponding parenthesis, bracket, or brace, respecting
nesting, if the cursor sits atop such a character.
Otherwise, it moves to the nearest enclosing bracketing character.
Either way, if successful, it leaves the mark set at the original
cursor position so that the enclosed text constitutes the selection.
.TP
.B ^Z
recenters the window so that the line containing the cursor lies in
the middle of its portion of the display.
.TP
.B ^Space^Z
causes the current window to occupy the entire display and recenters
the window.
With a numeric argument, however, it simply
moves the cursor to the indicated line in the view, with 1 being the
number of the first line.
.TP
.B ^Space=
(note that
.B =
is not a control character)
sets a bookmark on the current selection or cursor position.
A numeric argument may be used to manage multiple bookmarks.
.TP
.B ^Space-
(note that
.B -
is not a control character)
returns to a previous set bookmark, possibly identified with a
numeric argument.
.SH SELECTION
These commands are sensitive to the presence or absence of a current selection.
.TP
.B ^V
begins a new selection if non exists, setting its mark at the current cursor,
which is then typically navigated to its intended other end.
.B ^V in the presence of selection simply removes the mark.
.TP
.B ^Space^V
without a selection causes the entire current line to be
selected by placing the mark at the end of the line and the cursor at
its beginning.  It is the same as the command sequence
.B ^C^V^G
with no selection.
With a selection present,
.B ^Space^V
exchanges its cursor with its mark.
.TP
.B ^Space^D
with no selection causes all of the contiguous white space characters
surrounding the cursor to be selected, with the cursor at the beginning so
that they can be easily replaced by retyping.
.SH UNDO
.B aoeui
has infinite undo capabilities.
.TP
.B ^U
reverses the effects of the last command that modified the current
text in any of its views.
.TP
.B ^Space^U
reverses the effects of the most recent undo.
After
.BR ^U ,
any
.I other
command that modifies the text will permanently commit the undo.
.SH MODIFICATION
In the default mode, characters typed without a command indicator
are inserted at the current cursor position.
Further, if the cursor is at the beginning of a selection, the selection is
first cut to the clip buffer, so that the new text replaces it.
.TP
.B ^^
inserts an untypable control character into the text.
The very next key to be pressed is either taken literally,
if it is a control character, or converted to a control character
if it is not, and inserted.
(For example, you can press
.B ^^
and then hit ether Control-A or just a plain A, to get the
character code 0x01 inserted.)
.TP
.B ^Space^^
with a numeric argument, probably in hexadecimal, inserts the
specified Unicode character into the text in UTF-8 format.
.TP
.B Tab
(or
.BR ^I )
with no selection will simply insert a TAB character.
If at the end of a selection, however,
.B Tab
will attempt "tab completion" on the path name in the selection,
so that it may be used later to open up a file with
.BR ^X .
.TP
.B ^SpaceTab
(or
.BR ^Space^I )
will align the current line to the indentation of the previous one.
With a numeric argument between 1 and 20, it will set the tabstop pitch.
.TP
.B ^J
(or
.B ^Enter
under some terminal emulators)
inserts a new line into the text with automatic indentation.
.TP
.B ^SpaceEnter
(or
.BR ^Space^M )
opens up a new line after the current one.
.TP
.B Backspace
(or more properly, its synonym
.BR ^? ),
deletes the character immediately before the cursor.
.TP
.B ^D
with no selection deletes the character "under" the cursor.
When a selection exists,
.B ^D
moves it into the clip buffer, discarding any previously clipped text.
.TP
.B ^Space^D
with no selection will select surrounding white space, as described
earlier.
When a selection exists,
.B ^Space^D
moves it into the clip buffer, putting it before any old text if the cursor
was at its beginning and appending it to the clip buffer if the cursor
was at its end.
The intent is for multiple
.B ^Space^D
commands to collect data together in the same order in which
they are most likely to have been visited.
.TP
.B ^F
requires a selection, which is copied into the clip buffer and
then unmarked.
.TP
.B ^Space^F
is to
.B ^F
what
.B ^Space^D
is to
.BR ^D .
It copies the selection to the clip buffer, putting it at the beginning or the end in the same way as
.B ^Space^D
(above).
.TP
.B ^B
with no selection will paste the current clip buffer's contents.
But in the presence of a selection it performs a more general function:
the contents of the selection and the clip buffer are exchanged.
.SH SEARCHING
.TP
.B ^/
and its synonym
.B ^_
enter search mode.
Each non-command character that is typed thereafter will be appended
to the current search target string and the selection is moved to the
next occurence thereof.
Backspace will remove the last character from the search target and
move the selection back to its previous position.
.P
The case of alphabetic characters is
.I not
significant to the search.
.P
Most command characters will automatically take the editor out of
search mode before executing, and the most recently discovered
occurrence of the search target string will be its selection.
.B ^V
is typically used to leave search mode and abandon the selection.
A few commands, besides Backspace, have different
meanings in search mode:
.TP
.B ^/
with no characters in the search target string will cause the
last search's target string to be reused.
.TP
.B ^H
and
.B ^T
cause motion to the previous and next occurrences of the search
target string, not single-character motion.
.TP
.B Enter
simply leaves search mode and unsets the selection.
.SH TEXTS, VIEWS, and WINDOWS
.TP
.B ^K
saves
.I all
modified texts back to their files.
.TP
.B ^Space^K
saves just the current text.
.TP
.B ^X
with no selection inserts, as the new selection, the path name of the
current text.  With a selection containing a path name,
possibly constructed with the assistance of tab completion (above),
.B ^X
will raise up a window containing a view into the indicated file,
creating a new text to hold it if one does not already exist.
.TP
.B ^Space^X
with a selection will rename the current text, so that it will be
saved in another file.
.TP
.B ^W
finds an invisible view and associates it with the current window,
making its currint view invisible.  Hitting
.B ^W
repeatedly will cycle through all of the views.
If there was no invisible view,
.B ^W
creates a new scratch text, as does
.B ^Space;
below.
.TP
.B ^Space^W
does the same thing. but will close the window's current view,
and also its text if it was the last view thereof.
.TP
.B ^Y
splits the current window horizontally, raising up an invisible
or new view in the lower half of the original window.
.TP
.B ^Space^Y
splits the current window vertically, raising up an invisible or new
view in the right half of the original window.
.TP
.B ^P
moves to another window.
.TP
.B ^Space^P
moves to another window, closing the old one.
.TP
.B ^Space;
(note that
.B ;
is not a control character)
creates a new anonymous text.
.SH MACROS
.TP
.B ^Space^A
commences the recording of your keystrokes in the current view
as its
.IR macro,
which may contain anything but another macro or macro invocation.
.TP
.B ^A
replays the view's macro.
.SH SHELLS
.TP
.B ^E
with no selection will launch an interactive shell in a new scratch
text.
With a selection, however,
.B ^E
will execute the shell command in the selection with the contents
of the clip buffer, if any, as its standard input, and collect its
output asynchronously in the background to replace the selection.
This allows many helpful UNIX text processing commands to be
used directly upon portions of text, such as
.BI fmt (1),
.BI tr (1),
and a simple
.BI cat (1),
which is how you insert a copy of another file.
.TP
.B ^Space^E
with no selection will terminate the output of any asynchronous
child process that's still running.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SHELL
is used to name the program run by the
.B ^E
command.
.SH FILES
.TP
.IB file ~
is overwritten with the original contents of
.IR file .
.TP
.IB file #
contains the temporary image of the edited file
while
.B aoeui
is running, and may be useful in recovery if the editor
is killed.

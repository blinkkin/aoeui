These are the sources for the aoeui, a lightweight and unobtrusive
text editing program that is optimized for fast editing by users of
the Dvorak keyboard layout.  It was written in March 2007 by
peter@klausler.com.

The file COPYING contains the license under which aoeui is released;
please review it so that you understand your rights and responsibilities.
In particular, be aware that aoeui comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
and your use of the program is entirely at your own risk.

To build, edit first few lines of the Makefile to reflect your system.
